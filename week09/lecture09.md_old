## Today - and assignment

We will be ending early for the noontime presentation at CIRSS.

You will have an assignment for this presentation, to be turned in by class
next week.  Your assignment is to follow along with this talk, take notes, and
supply a writeup about its usage of visualization:

 * How was visualization used in the talk?
 * How was visualization used in the discovery?
 * What were the types of visualization used? What comments did you have about
   them?

This writeup should utilize the vocabulary we use in class, and the
classification of the types of visualization.  It should be at a minimum 2
pages and include a description of the discovery presented, its context, and a
reasonable discussion of how visualization was used in the process.
