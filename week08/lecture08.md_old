---

## Choices

 * Can I get ahold of this software?
 * Do I install it, or do I use it on a server?
 * What's the user interface like?
 * Is it declarative or is it procedural?

---

## License: Software

 * What can you do with the software?
 * Can you study the software?
 * Who can you share it with?
 * Who can you give your derivative works to?

---

## License: Software

 * Copyleft: share and share-alike
 * Non-copyleft: share, but don't necessarily need to share-alike
 * https://choosealicense.com/

---

## License: Data

 * What can you do with the data?
 * How do you credit that data?
 * Can the data be redistributed, remixed, modified?
 * http://opendefinition.org/guide/data/
 * https://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing

---

## Accessibility

 * Is the software installed locally on your machine?
 * Is it hosted at a local or remote instance?
 * Who owns the visualizations, and how is access to them controlled?

---

## Interface

How do you interact with the software?

 * Declarative: how do you want the plot to look?
 * Procedural: what are the steps to make the plot look that way?

---

## Example Declarative

```python
Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    X('precipitation', bin=True),
    Y('count(*):Q')
)
```

## Evaluation: Costs

The "cost" of software is not exclusively the number of dollars you place on
the counter when you get a big cardboard box with marketing blurbs on the side.

Think about cost in several ways:

 * Monetary cost for *you* to use the software
 * Monetary cost for *someone else* to view your creations
 * Temporal cost of setting up
 * Cognitive cost for learning and using the system (documentation matters!)
 * Transmission cost for sharing your creations

---

## Evaluation: Aesthetics

Visualization is trendy.

When you construct something, think about the different ways it will be
interpreted:

 * How will the viewer understand the story of the data?
 * What will the _message_ of the visualization be?
 * Does the visualization say something about you and your handling of the data
   or utilization of tools?

---

## Assignment 5

Your assignment is to pick three of the following possibilities and write up a
set of comparisons for constructing the *same* visualization.

 * Matplotlib
 * Bokeh
 * Plotly
 * D3 / Vega / Vega-lite / Altair
 * bqplot
 * R / RStudio

These comparisons should be:

 * What is the license for the software?
 * What is the focus of the software?
 * Does it have interactivity, and how easy is it?
 * What are the pros and cons of using it?

---

## Markdown

We'll be using markdown a bit in this course, and even more so as we move
toward using Idyll.  You can think of it as standard text that we mark "up" to
provide indications of formatting:

 * To **bold**, use `**two asterisks**`
 * You can _italicize_ with `_underscores_`
 * Try out making bullet lists with `*` on each line
 * Links are fun: `[link text](http://example.com/)`

## Maps

The Earth is a sphere.

(Fun question: to what degree is it a sphere?)

Have you ever wrapped a piece of paper around a ball?

---

## Projections

To map from one system to another, we must "project" from the original sphere
to the flat object we are observing.

What are some things we could preserve during such a projection?

---

## Projections: Common Preservations

Typically, one or more of these will be preserved, or at least, the distortion
will be minimized:

 * Area
 * Shape (Conformal)
 * Distance

There are other properties that can be preserved, as well.  Typically, maps
will be a "compromise" between preserving different properties.

What happens when we preserve one property over another?

---

Mercator is a "conformal" projection.  What is wrong with this?

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/mercator.png" data-background-size="auto 80%" -->

---

## Projections: Distortions

We can characterize distortions in a projection by examining how a known shape
appears on them.  The Tissot Ellipse of Distortion is a method of showing this
by drawing circles of a fixed radius and examining their elliptical distortion.

## Discussion

What happens when we make a map that minimizes one region and maximizes
another?

---

## Maps: Coordinate Systems

Once we have our system of transformation, we need to have a method of
representing positions.

Three common baseline methods:

 * Spherical coordinates
 * Latitude and Longitude
 * Degrees, minutes, seconds

Take care with:

 * Zero points
 * North/South, East/West
 * Ranges

---

## Intro to cartopy

CartoPy is a toolkit that builds on matplotlib to create fast, easy map
representations.

We will be relying on three key concepts:

 * Axes projections (similar to our polar projections)
 * Coordinate representations
 * Shapes

Using these, we will be able to build out many visualizations.

---

## CartoPy: Projections

We start out by constructing an axes in CartoPy that uses a given projection:

```python
import cartopy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection=cartopy.crs.Mollweide())
ax.coastlines()
```

What does this do?

---

## CartoPy: Coordinate Reference Systems

Transforming from a spherical reference system to a flat reference system is
the job of the projection; transforming from one discretization of a sphere to
another is the job of the coordinate system.

We can utilize Coordinate Reference Systems to describe the *input* coordinate
system and the *rasterization* system are described.

For example, there are several different ways to draw "straight" lines.  We can
do both `PlateCarree` and `Geodetic`.

```python
c_lat, c_lon = 40.1164, -88.2434
a_lat, a_lon = -18.8792, 47.5079
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection = cartopy.crs.PlateCarree())
ax.gridlines()
ax.coastlines()
ax.set_global()
ax.plot([c_lon, a_lon], [c_lat, a_lat], transform = cartopy.crs.PlateCarree())
ax.plot([c_lon, a_lon], [c_lat, a_lat], transform = cartopy.crs.Geodetic())
```
