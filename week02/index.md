# Week 2 - Data Storage and Operations

For this week's code-along demo, if you haven't already done so, please be sure to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Please also download this dataset:

 * [pokemon.csv](data/pokemon.csv)
 * [IL_Building_Inventory.csv](data/IL_Building_Inventory.csv)

This week we discussed how data is stored on disk and in memory, how that
interacts with our visualization process, and we introduced the notion of a
palette of operations you can apply to data to visualize it.
