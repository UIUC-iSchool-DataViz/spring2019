## Drawing

How do we draw an image?

---

## Displays

![](images/screens.png)

notes:
all modern displays are grids of pixels - pixel literally means "picture element". We divide the whole image into discrete pieces.

## Let's draw a line.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/line.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

---

## Let's draw a line.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/line.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

```
start = (x0, y0)
end   = (x1, y1)
width = 1.0
```
<!-- .element: class="left_abs" style="width: 50%"-->

notes:
you can see a line is basically 5 bytes in memory - one byte for each integer end point coordinate, and one byte for the width.

## Representations

 1. Numerical Data
 2. ???
 3. Pixels On Screen

---

## Representations

We will concern ourselves with understanding two representations of an image:
the **raster** representation and the **vector** representation.

---

## Representations: raster

 * Each pixel is represented as a color
 * Common file formats such as GIF, JPG, PNG
 * Compression can be lossy (JPG) or lossless (PNG)
 * Common Editors: Paint, Photoshop

In a raster image, you describe precisely what to display.

---

## Representations: vector

 * Each component is defined as a "drawing" component, or some action to be
   taken by the rendering engine.  This can include paths, patterns,
   shapes, and text.  Components have properties associated with them.
 * Common file formats are SVG, PDF, EPS
 * The display does not exist until it is "rendered."
 * Options for compression include (lossless) text compression, although
   the rendering engine can simplify display
 * Common Editors: Illustrator, Inkscape

---

## Representations

1 line (uncompressed, single precision)</br> 
 * x0, y0, x1, y1, width </br>
 * 5 bytes </br>
 * 40 bits </br>

1 pixel (uncompressed, singe bit-depth)</br>
 * 1 bit

If a line covers fewer than 40 pixels, raster is less memory than vector

notes:
keep in mind, compression algorithms can make these comparisons a little fuzzier

---

## Representations

![](images/bigPixels.jpg)

notes:
in this image, all the lines ARE less than 40 pixels

---

## Representations

![](images/smallPixels.jpg)

notes:
but in this image, the lines aren't. What's the difference? 

The difference is the ratio of the size of the lines to the raster resolution.

---

## Representations

![](images/zoomedPixels.jpg)

notes:
and now we're back to less than 40 pixels per line. But what changed? Not the resolution.

Now most of the line goes off the screen. We haven't changed the coordinates, we've just zoomed in.

Raster data discards any information outside of the domain. Vector data preserves all information, regardless of boundaries.

---

## Raster Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|
| | 1 Line | 10 Lines | 1000 Lines | 1e6 Lines |
|`600x600` | 45kb | 45kb | 45kb | 45kb |
|`1200x1200` | 180kb | 180kb | 180kb | 180kb |
|`2400x2400` | 720kb | 720kb | 720kb | 720kb |

(uncompressed, 1-bit images)

600 x 600 = 360,000 bits / 8 = 45,000 bytes = 45 kilobytes

notes:
You can see that regardless of the number of shapes, the image size stays the same

---

## Vector Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|
| | 1 Line | 10 Lines | 1000 Lines | 1e6 Lines |
|`600x600` | 5 bytes | 50 bytes | 5kb | 5mb |
|`1200x1200` | 5 bytes | 50 bytes | 5kb | 5mb |
|`2400x2400` | 5 bytes | 50 bytes | 5kb | 5mb |

(uncompressed, single precision)

notes:
Now no matter the image size, the shape data stays the same size. You can see that with a large number of shapes, the raster representation becomes smaller.

---

## Let's draw a circle.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/single_circle.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

```
center = (x0, y0)
radius = 1.0
```
<!-- .element: class="left_abs" style="width: 50%"-->

## Let's draw many circles.

## Raster or Vector?

![](images/menger1.png)

8 points
2.96 kb

notes:
Would it be easier to store this cube as a vector or as raster?
This is larger than a few bytes because it's storing other useful values in CG software.

---

## Raster or Vector?

![](images/menger2.png)

160 points
12.28 kb

notes:
Does this change it?
This is a recursive shape known as a Menger Sponge. Each cube keeps getting replaced with the whole previous shape.

---

## Raster or Vector?

![](images/menger3.png)

3200 points
445.05 kb

---

## Raster or Vector?

![](images/menger4.png)

64000 points

notes:
Does it make a difference yet?

1.28M points

## Raster or Vector?

25.6M points

---

## Raster or Vector?

![](images/menger6.png)

25.6M points
3.73 gb

1280 x 720 = 921600

notes:
There are 25 times more points than pixels, and most of the pixels don't include the shape.


---

## Infinite resolution

![](images/nature.jpg)

notes:
nature has effectively infinite resolution, down to the atom.
It's much easier to discretize this scene to the level of pixels than to try to use vector shapes to describe everything happening in the photo.

## Text

Modern fonts are composed of glyphs defined by functional forms of their shape.
Font rendering engines such as freetype2 can generate bitmaps for fonts
rendered at specific resolutions.

In raster image file formats, fonts do not need to be embedded: the rasterized,
rendered version is the one that is transmitted to the viewer.

In vector file formats, fonts can either be embedded (in whole or in part) or
fallback fonts available to the rendering engine can be used.

## Geographical Data

Which of these are better represented as raster or vector?
 1. State Boundaries
 2. Relief (height) Map
 3. Population Density
 4. Capitol Cities

notes:
a simple cheat is anytime you see the word "density", it's easier to represent with raster.

---

## Discussion Time

In your groups: can you come up with a few situations in which a raster
representation is "obviously" better and a few in which a vector representation
is "obviously" better?

Some things to consider: 

 * Where is it being displayed?
 * How is the image being transmitted, and what concerns are there?
 * What is in the image?

---

## Visualization Palette

This week we will discuss "mutation" of data.

---

## Mutation Operations

 * Mathematical operations, such as injective operations.
   * Logarithmic versus linear representations
   *  Arithmetic or multiplicative relationships
   *  Dimensionality remapping
 * Smoothing (reduction)
 * Histograms (reduction)

Smoothing will be an extensive topic for next week.

notes:
smoothing and histograms are only mutations if we change the number of data points (reduction). If we keep the existing points in a one-to-one (injective) way, we're not running a mutation.

---

## Binning and Histograms

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/circles.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 40%"-->

<div style="width: 50%">
We can aggregate data points according to their position along defined
dimensions.

* $\Sigma 1$ (count)
* $\Sigma v_i$ (sum)
* $\frac{\Sigma v_i }{ \Sigma 1}$ (average)
* $\frac{\Sigma v_i w_i}{\Sigma w_i}$ (weighted average)

---

## Splitting Operations

We can split or group collections of data based on some characteristic.

c = []
c.append(2)
c.append('hi there')

d = {}
