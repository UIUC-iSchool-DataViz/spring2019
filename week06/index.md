# Week 6 - Comparisons, Elements, Engines and More

Please have the Illinois Building Inventory CSV file handy again:
 * [IL Building Inventory](data/IL_Building_Inventory.csv)

This week we learned about comparative charts and introduced two new visualization engines: [bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot/blob/master/README.md) and [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/).
