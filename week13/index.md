# Week 13 - Graphics, Volumes, D3.js & How to learn new webdev things

This week will give a brief overview of graphics concepts and the rendering of images.  We'll also learn some D3.js and figure out how to learn new web development concepts.

# Resources

For the D3.js portion, we'll be starting from our previous Idyll website using:
  * This <a href="corg_website_files/index.idyll" download>index.idyll file</a>.
  * And <a href="https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spring2019online/week11/images/imgcropped.png" download>this image</a>.
  
For volume rendering in Python we'll be using:
  * This tiny cosmology <a href="http://yt-project.org/data/enzo_tiny_cosmology.tar.gz">dataset (~420Mb)</a>
  
### We will build to:

 * This final [index.idyll file](corg_website_files/prep/index.idyll)
 * This [custom js script](corg_website_files/prep/my-custom-d3-component.js)
 * This [custom js map](corg_website_files/prep/map-custom-d3-component.js)

# Outline of Topics

This week our objectives are: (1) understand how images are made from spatial datasets - rendering of 3D objects to make them look like/close to photos, (2) learn a bit of javascript, (3) see some methods to learn new viz software.

 * Lecture
   1. Intro to 3D computer graphics concepts & tools

 * Programming
   1. JS scripting in Idyll webpages
   1. How to add D3.js ideas into your webpage -> how to debug this process
   1. Volume rendering in Python
