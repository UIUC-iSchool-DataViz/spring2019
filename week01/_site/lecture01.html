<h2 id="timed-activity">Timed activity!</h2>

<p>On a piece of paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the most memorable movies you saw over the last year?</li>
  <li>How would you quantify your experience with programming?</li>
  <li>Do you prefer cats or dogs?</li>
  <li>How many people are in each row in this classroom?</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
We’re going to use these pieces of data to explore how we might approach
visualization.  Each of these items is a different <em>type</em> of data –
qualitative, quantitative, elements drawn from sets, and sets of numerical
data.</p>

<p>Trying to visualize each one will give us a basic idea of how we might think
about these types of data, and how we approach visualizing them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Break into groups based on your birth month, and visualize the results by whatever method you choose: by hand, by computer, or otherwise.</p>

<p>notes:
Don’t get used to sitting in the same seat in this room!  We’re going to move
around and try things, starting with hand-crafting some visualizations.</p>

<h2 id="intake-survey">Intake Survey</h2>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/7CQi5H">goo.gl/7CQi5H</a></p>

<p>notes:
This survey will help guide the level of instruction during the course.
Although we will be going over many of these topics, by knowing how well you
are already acquainted with them I can guide the instruction to greater or
lesser detail.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Week 1 (Jan 14): Introduction, syllabus, examples, and some basics</li>
  <li>Week 2 (Jan 28): Operational palette, structured python, and files</li>
  <li>Week 3 (Feb 4): Quantitative plots, plot components</li>
  <li>Week 4 (Feb 11): Histograms and distributions</li>
  <li>Week 5 (Feb 18): R and ggplot</li>
  <li>Week 6 (Feb 25): Images: color, colormaps</li>
  <li>Week 7 (Mar 4): Comparisons between datasets</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
This is a rough syllabus!  These are many of the topics we will cover, but
based on how the course proceeds and how folks respond, we may shorten or
lengthen different topics.</p>

<p>The organization here is designed to start out slow, dealing with how to
program python for visualization, understanding how data is laid out, which
operations we can apply to that data, and then moving on to representing data
in different ways.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="syllabus-1">Syllabus</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Week 8 (Mar 11): Comparisons between different datasets</li>
  <li>Week 9 (Mar 25): Network visualization</li>
  <li>Week 10 (Apr 1): Principles of interactive visualization</li>
  <li>Week 11 (Apr 8): Interactive visualization with Python</li>
  <li>Week 12 (Apr 15): Scientific visualization</li>
  <li>Week 13 (Apr 22): Advanced topics</li>
  <li>Week 14 (Apr 29): Group presentations</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
Toward the end of class we are going to have a slightly more free-form set of
discussion points.  Your final projects will be somewhat open-ended, requiring
more group work and collaboration than the preceding assignments.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="class-mission">Class Mission</h1>

<p>While you are already a <em>consumer</em> of visualizations, your perspective should change to that of a <em>producer</em> of visualizations. You should be comfortable reading AND writing imagery.</p>

<p>notes:
We will be discussing this as the semester goes on, but the principal outcome I
want you to take away from this class is understanding how to transform data
into its visual representation, and to take that understanding with you as you
observe visualizations presented to you.</p>

<p>By developing visualizations, you will grow to understand the choices that
influence those visualizations, and you will bring that with you while
consuming information visually.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="the-things-i-want-you-to-take-away">The Things I Want You To Take Away</h1>

<ul>
  <li>You should know the basics of how to manipulate data – aggregations,
filterings, and other operations.</li>
  <li>I want you to know <em>some</em> of the packages that are out there to visualize
data.  These will mostly be Python-based, with a couple in Javascript.</li>
  <li>You won’t learn how to use dashboarding software (e.g. Tableau) in detail. Instead, we
will focus on the different operations that go into dashboarding software.</li>
  <li>By the end of the course, you will have had the opportunity to look at and
build visualizations in several different domains and understand how to
interpret, critique and improve them.</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
This course <em>will</em> teach you some things about how to code, how to build
visualizations, but we’re going to focus much more on learning about how to
construct visualizations and why we make the choices that we do.  If we choose
one way to present data, does that convey information more readily?  Or does it
get in the way of the underlying meaning?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="overview---themes-and-goals">Overview - Themes and Goals</h2>

<ol>
  <li>What are the components of an effective visualization of quantitative data?</li>
  <li>What tools and ecosystems are available for visualizing data?</li>
  <li>What systems can be put in place to generate visualizations rapidly and with high-fidelity representation?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="structure-of-class">Structure of Class</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Topic introduction and lecture (60-90 minutes)</li>
  <li>Hands-on, collaborative coding</li>
  <li>Wrap-up</li>
</ul>

<p>You will each be assigned to a group to do collective note-taking.  The day
before class each week, you will be notified that you will be taking notes the
next day and you will be provided the link to a collaborative document.
Following the lecture, your notes will be added to the course website.</p>

<p>notes:
This structure will likely be deviated from during the course, but in general
we will start with lecture, take a break, then continue with collaborative or
hands-on exercises using group coding.</p>

<p>During the group coding, I might lead the class in some visualization in
Python, Javascript, or something else.  During this section, I expect that
students will <em>follow along</em> with what is going on – typing in the specific
commands, and maybe even trying different things as we go.  It is not meant to
simply be a “performance” of coding, but instead an opportunity to learn.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<ul>
  <li>70% Weekly assignments in prose or code form</li>
  <li>30% Final project</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
Your weekly assignments will take different forms.  The first assignment will
be exclusively prose and hand-writing, but subsequent assignments will be
either notebook (coding) based or prose-based as well.</p>

<p>The final project will be described later in class, but will take the form of a
group project that touches on coding as well as visual design.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Weekly, assigned in class, collected following class</li>
  <li>Prose assignments: deconstruction or analysis of a visualization or a dataset.</li>
  <li>Coding assignments: Jupyter notebooks following step by step through
collection and processing of data and the visualization of that data</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Plagiarism is about copying ideas.</li>
  <li>Cite all code you utilize from elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
When programming, I expect that you will do things like search on the internet
to find help with a given problem.  This is fine.</p>

<p>But, you <em>must</em> cite where any code snippets came from.  And you <em>must</em> note if
you are working with other people in the group!</p>

<p>Using snippets of code is fine – but you may not copy large-scale amounts of
code from other work (for example, other visualizations) and pass it off as
your own.  Always cite, and be reasonable in what you utilize.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="our-tools">Our tools</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Python, with some R and Javascript along the way</li>
  <li>Jupyter and Jupyter notebooks on a Jupyterhub</li>
  <li>The occasional usage of a shell such as bash</li>
  <li>Once in a while some git, and GitHub</li>
  <li>Slack</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
You will be expected to write code in Python, and to learn the very basics of
Javascript.  Your projects may be turned in via git.  We will also utilize
Slack for class communication.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="images/jh_arch.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>notes:
Jupyterhub is a software system for launching multiple independent notebooks
that can share access to data and installed software.  Ours is administered by
the iSchool.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jupyterhub-guidelines">Jupyterhub Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jupyterhub.ischool.illinois.edu/">jupyterhub.ischool.illinois.edu</a></li>
  <li>Please store your notebooks on- and off-site</li>
  <li>Submissions will be via <code class="highlighter-rouge">nbgrader</code></li>
  <li>Data will be available at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home/shared/spr18-is590dv/data/</code></li>
  <li>Previous lectures will be in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home/shared/spr18-is590dv/fall2018/</code></li>
  <li>You will have access to conda, etc, but I may rebuild images to add packages.</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
It is possible that your JupyterHub instance may be lost – don’t store mission
critical data there without a backup.  It should be possible to share data
between people on the system, but I won’t pretend to know the right way to do
that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why do we visualize?</li>
  <li>What types of data do we visualize?</li>
  <li>How do we visualize?</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
We’re going to start out at a very high-level, discussing why we choose to
visualize versus other types of representation, what types of data, and how we
might do it.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>

<p>(Or rather, why <em>wouldn’t</em> we visualize?)</p>

<p>notes:
Not everything suits itself to visualization – and part of the reason for that
is the necessary reductionism that visualization can require.</p>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/fov.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<p>notes:
Human perception is biased by the tools we have to work with - our senses and our minds.</p>

<p>Visual information is communicated through our eyes, which have limitations. At
the most basic level, we can see a range of about 210 degrees horizontally with
one or both eyes.  The region that is covered by both (“binocular”) is about
114 degrees in extent.</p>

<p>You can only cram so much information into the human eye.</p>

<p>notes:
When we think about visual communication of information, we <em>must</em> think about
how human physiology interacts with those visuals.</p>

<p>Also, fair warning: I’m not a medical doctor.</p>

<p>This diagram shows the visual acuity of a “standard” human eye, as a function
of angular distance from the fovea.  We have to think about this in
<em>conjunction</em> with our field of view.</p>

Everyone close your eyes while they read. See what I mean?  It’s a stunt.</p>

<p>Your ears are not as good at processing large amounts of information as your eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="images/fredgraph.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>notes:
You might immediately notice a few things about this image, but one item that
we will talk about as class goes on is that often visualizations can have a
consistent style. Often this can be associated with a professional brand identity. FRED in particular has a “branding” that is quite obvious,
even without the logo.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="who-are-you-visualizing-for">Who are you visualizing for?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>For yourself?</li>
  <li>For a peer?</li>
  <li>For someone else?</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
<em>Whenever</em> you build a visualization you need to think about the context that you can assume on the part of your viewer. For instance, in my work at the NCSA, we focus on outreach to the public, which might include children, or politicians, OR expert scientists, so our visualizations have to be fairly approachable and movie-like. But some of my visualization colleagues at the NCSA work specifically with scientists, and their visualizations might be highly complex with lots of annotation and specific numerical values.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="tenet-1">Tenet 1:</h1>

<p>“Visualizing data” is not a strict subset of “making an image.”</p>

<p>notes:
Much of the visualization process is data processing, which is less subjective than a lot of image making.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Collection of the data</li>
  <li>Organization of that data</li>
  <li>Representation of that data</li>
</ul>

<p>notes:
We will approach visualization as a multi-stage process of data
collection, organization and representation.</p>
